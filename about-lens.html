            In all seriousness, there's not a lot that goes into it<br />
            <br />
            I boot up FL Studio, pop in a couple sounds, record some vocals, and... that's all, right‽<br />
            <br />

            Well, since I choose to produce as well as write, engineer, and record my own vocals, it becomes a bit more complicated than that 😄<br />

        <div class="card-body">
            This is the component of music that changes the most.<br />
            One of the reasons being I do it the most. My Google Keep is <em>filled</em> with (literally) thousands on thousands of verses, choruses, and song Ideas, each one ready to record, or partway there to a full song.<br />
            <br />
            My goal is to keep it honest. I ain't saying get up on the mic and be all serious, just speak from a real place.

            There is one rule of thumb that I <em>always</em> follow:<br />
            <strong><h4 class="my-2">KEEP IT SIMPLE</h4></strong>
            also<br />
            <h5 class="my-2">If ever in doubt, <strong>ditch it</strong><br /></h5>
            A song isn't one sound, it has to do with each individual sound and how it's selected in accordance with each other (the mix).<br />
            Because of this, it is <strong class="text-danger">never</strong> a good idea to spend extra time on a sound, trying to get it to sound good. Move on and find another that fits that spot better.<br />
            <br />
            Do Not Succumb to the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

        <div class="card-header"><h1>Quality Audio</h1></div>
        <div class="card-body">
            Early into my music journey, I found that sound quality was a large factor in whether people would even consider your music as valid. Because of that, I chose to build a broke-man's vocal booth (of which I am pictured in below), constructed out of a mattress, two blankets, and <em>many</em> pillows.<br />
            Albeit, this did not gain me <em>any</em> listeners, I pressed on, knowing this improved sound was something <strong>I</strong> am <em>actually</em> happy with.<br />

            I also found that the more thought you give something, that doesn't necesarrily translate into the finished product or, what really even matters: You.<br />

        <div class="card-body">
            After a few months of rapping, I started to be able to think of lyrics not as words, but as what they truthfully are: a tool.<br />
            With this revelation, I started to understand music I had not been able to before, as when I started out, ALL I could focus on <small>(especially in a rap/hip-hop song)</small> was the <strong>words</strong> that went with the <em>lyrics</em>.<br />
            But then, I got it! <br />
            <br />
            Sometimes life is <strong>so</strong> shit, all you can manage to do is <small>(barely)</small> bop your head to whatever useless frequency is mindlessly flowing through your ears, into your skull.<br />
            And without that mindless, unbiased frequency, it can seem like <em>all</em> you are left with is shit...<br />
            <br />
            Once I realized this, I started to make new goals. No longer was I after the 'most-intricate bar' or 'spitting the fastest verse'. No... <strong>Now</strong>, this was <strong><em>real</em></strong><br />
            <br />
            As real as Wind against the Stone.<br />
            Water upon the Sand.<br />
            A breeze in your face, carrying your soul to a far-away land...<br />

            And,<br />
            <em>Truthfully, </em><br />
            <br />
            I have.<br />
            <br />
            It took <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0XZaLnVbuh6TvIWbRdGRfb?si=cR0gXFNBQCaMs_lLk8yHZw" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lens' Artist Page - Spotify">music</a>, Support from amazing, amazing people (Shouts-Out you, Pops!), and <small>(too much)</small> time, but I did it. <strong>I</strong> removed my slugworth-self from it's previous habitat: A <em>pill-filled, </em><strong>arrogant, </strong>ignorant, <em>shitty, </em><strong><em>shell</em></strong>-of-a-human-being that I am ashamed to have, even once, been.<br />
            Although, without each previous moment, I wouldn't be who I am in the current one...<br />
            So who knows...<br />
            <br />
            <em>Maybe One Day I <small>(or those around me)</small> <strong>Will</strong> Appreciate all the <strong>Shit</strong> I Went Through</em><br />
            <br />
            <em>Until Then, </em><br />
            <strong>Cheers.</strong>
