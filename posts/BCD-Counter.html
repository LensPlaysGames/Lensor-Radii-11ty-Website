        A great project that helped me learn some wiring basics, test my breadboards, figure out how to use Integrated Circuits, and get familiar with counting in binary! <br />
    I used a 74LS90 IC to increment the count, a 555 timer to debounce the push-button, and LEDs to display the binary output!</span>

        <span class="text-left">
            A wonderful little device! I had a lot of fun building this little circuit, and it really solidified how binary numbers work in my head, as well as switch debouncing. <br />
            I really recommend this circuit starting out! It's simple enough to understand and has actually-useful applications in the real world (clocks, debouncing inputs, RC time constants, and more!).<br />
            Also, it's fun to push a button and have lights move around 😄.<br />
            <br />
            Speaking of how it functioned: just push the button, and the counter IC (integrated chip) would increment by one. The output LEDs will display the incremented number from 0-9 in binary 
            (looping back to 0 when it gets to 10). This is called binary-coded decimal when we stop at 10 in decimal even though counting in binary.<br />
            <br />
            <small>For this next bit, I'm assuming you have basic knowledge about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC" target="_blank">555 timer IC</a> and how it works internally. If not, 
                <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/555_timer.html" target="_blank">here</a> is a great resource for more information regarding that topic.</small><br />
            <br />
            But what's actually happening in the circuit?? Let's go over it.
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item gradient-diag-shine text-body">
                    Normally, Pin 2 (Trigger) is pulled HIGH through the resistor, R2, and Pin 7 (Discharge) is pulled LOW through an internal ground connection in the 555.<br />
                    When the push-button is depressed, Pin 2 (Trigger) is pulled LOW through the switch, pushing the 555 timer into it's unstable mode.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item gradient-diag-bright text-body">
                    When Pin 2 (Trigger) goes LOW, Pin 3 (Output) is set HIGH due to one of 555's internal Op-Amps. 
                    When Pin 3 (Output) goes HIGH, the internal inverted output goes LOW, which is connected to the base of the internal discharge transistor.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item gradient-diag-shine text-body">
                    Cool! This stops current flow from R1, through Pin 7 (Discharge), to ground. 
                    This means Pin 6 (Threshold) will be pulled HIGH, but only at the rate at which the charge at capacitor C1 will increase, as they are wired in parallel.
                    This delay defines the length that the output clock will be HIGH, or 1.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item gradient-diag-bright text-body">
                    Once the charge at Pin 6 (Threshold) crosses the... well... threshold, the other one of the 555's two internal Op-Amps will output HIGH, resetting the internal SR-Latch (short for Set-Reset), which, in turn, sets Pin 3 (Output) LOW.
                    When Pin 3 (Output) goes LOW, the inverted output goes HIGH internally, activating the base of the internal discharge transistor.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item gradient-diag-shine text-body">
                    Now, that charge that we were able to store in C1 is ripped from it's clutches as current travels through R1, into Pin 7 (Discharge), straight to ground.
                    Once the charge across C1 is zero, we are back at our starting state, completing our loop. The circuit will stay in this stable mode (LOW, in this case) until pushed unstable once again.
                </li>
            </ul>
